# Terminal
Unlike the graphical user interfaces most people use to interact with their digital systems, the terminal or command line interface, is a text-based system interface. Knowing a few of the commands enables a user to navigate the file structure, as well as create and interact with the files.

## Finding Your Way in the Terminal
Below are a few commands that will help you get started working with the terminal. Once you know your way around, you can pick up new commands as needed.

### Where Am I?
**pwd** stands for ***print working directory*** and is used to display your current location in the terminal. If you get lost, you can use this to figure out where you are, and help determine how to navigate to where you want to be.

### What Files Can I See?
**ls** stands for ***list*** and is used to display a list of the files/directories present in your current directory.

### Change My Location
**cd** stands for ***change directory*** and is followed by a string that represents the path to a directory you'd like to move to. Along with this, periods can be used to represent the current directory and to move back through parent directories; one period is current, two is back one level, three is two levels, etc.

### Let Me Create
Once you've gotten the hang of movin around, you're going to want to create and organize files and directories.
**mkdir** stands for ***make directory*** and is followed by a string that represents the name of your directory.
**touch** is followed by the string and extension to create a file of a certain type within the current directory.
