Hello, I'm Brandon Perard, and this is a collection of my reading notes; you can also check out my profile below.[^1]

## Growth Mindset
The "**growth mindset**" are the practices you use to take on ambiguous and challengeing tasks, like *learning something new*. When adversity and frustration take hold, it's easy to give up or get distracted, so it's important to build up the habits that allow us to move forward.
### Reminders to Grow
- Minimize focus-stealing distractions
- When motivation is low, take a break to recharge
- If an obstacle becomes a mountain, take smaller steps
