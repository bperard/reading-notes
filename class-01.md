# Getting Started
Like any other project, creating a site is a process that requires understanding of the pieces and how they come together. To make this a successful process, it's also important to have a plan that addresses your goals, and the users who will eventually be using your site.

## HTML
HTML is the language you will use to create the structure of your site. HTML creates this structure using element tags, attributes, and content.

## CSS
CSS is the language you will use to style the content on your page. Many sites can present you with the same structure and content, so adding in the CSS is what makes the site your own.

## JAVASCRIPT
Finally, JavaScript is the language we use to add dynamic elements and interaction to our pages. A dynamic site is able to provide content that is unique to each user.

## INTERNET
Once you have all of these elements, all that's left is to host your site online. This final step allows users to have your site sent to them so they can view it in their browser.
