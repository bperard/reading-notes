# Building a Site
**HTML** stands for *hypertext markup language* and is the language used to create web pages. However, before you start building a site, you'll want to have a plan.

## Wireframing
Wireframing is a great practice to use when planning your site. The goal of wireframing is to build the basic structure and flow of your site, like a rough draft. Don't put too much effort into the content and style, but do consider a few of the following points:
1 Research the content of your site so you know who you user is, and how you'd like to present your content.
2 Consolidate your research into an easy to reference guide you can refer to as needed.
3 Map out the flow of your site so that you have an idea of the key pages and elements needed for your wireframe.
4 Make your wireframe an outline of the important pieces, you will add the finer details when you build your site.
5 Once you have the basic structure complete, fill in other necessary details that help to bring your site together.
6 Use your wireframe to build a prototype, and test out your site.

If you're not sure if your wireframe is complete, consider these goals:
- **Clarity**: Can a user clearly tell the purpose of your site, and how to use it?
- **Confidence**: Is your site organized & intuitive, or does unpredictability lead to confused users?
- **Simplicity**: Can a user easily locate needed content and interactions, or they get distracted by cluttered pages?

## HTML
Once your wireframing is done, you're ready to bust out the HTML!

### Tags
HTML is made up of elements that are defined by **< tags >**. Most, but not all elements, have an **< opening >** and **</ closing >** tag.
Tags consist of an **< elementName attributes="setting" > content </ elementName >**
- elementName: Defines the type of tag
- attributes: modify the settings of the tag
- content: what the tag presents

The structure and content of a site is built using these tags. Styling will be added later through *cascading style sheets*.

### Semantic HTML
Semantic coding is used to add clarity of purpose to what you build. Semantic tags tell you their purpose before adding content; header tags make a header, nav tags point you to navigation elements, etc.
This makes it easier for you, or a collaborator, to understand what's happening in your code, allows search engines to understand what's contained in your site, and aids in navigation with accessibility tools like screen readers.
