# Flexbox

**Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**
Flexbox is made to control how content is displayed across the main axis.

**Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**
The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.

**How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**
When items are reordered differently than how they are structured in the html elements.

**What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?**
Flexbox allows you to do more complex arrangements than float alone can do, like:

- Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
- Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
- Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

**How does this topic connect with your long term goals?**
Knowing flexbox is important for being able to interpret what's happening on other pages, and it's a useful tool to have when deciding the layout for our own pages.
