## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API (Watch a Twitch streamer code an Express API in 20 minutes!)

- Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?  
CRUD refers to the functionality we use when interacting with a database, and REST is the API protocol for getting resources from a server.

- If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?  
Build express server, build routes for different HTTP requests and endpoints, build schema for shaping data received for database, convert data to models, add CRUD functionality for database interactions.
