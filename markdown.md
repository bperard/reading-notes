# Markdown
When creating documentation for your projects, the markdown language is a good option. Learning a little bit of simple syntax will allow you to add more sophisticated formatting to your text.

## Markdown Syntax Examples
- Text can be made *italic*, **bold**, or ***both*** by surrounding it with one, two, or three asterisks.
- <sub>Subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> can be made using sub and sup tags
- Hex, RGB, and HSL values can be used for text
- A link can be made using brackets for the text, with the url in parantheses immediately after; [return to index](https://bperard.github.io/reading-notes/)
