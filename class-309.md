## Functional Programming Concepts

- What is functional programming?  
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?  
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic), and it does not cause any observable side effects.

- What are the benefits of a pure function?  
The code is easier to test, and no mocking is needed; expected output will always be the same for a given input.

- What is immutability?  
The state of the object cannot change after it's created.

- What is Referential transparency?  
Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

- What is a module?  
A JavaScript file that you can utilize from within a different file.

- What does the word ‘require’ do?  
Allows you to reference an outside file through the file path.

- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?  
Export module, require in the file you want to reference, and set the module to a variable for use within the current file.

- What do we have to do to make a module available?  
Export module, require in the file you want to reference, and set the module to a variable for use within the current file.
