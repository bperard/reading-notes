## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

- What is node.js?  
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

- In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?  
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

- What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?  
Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

- What is npm?  
This is a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will.

- What version of node are you running on your machine?  
v19.1.0

- What version of npm are you running on your machine?  
8.19.3

- What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?  
npm install jshint

- What is node used for?  
Now that we know what Node and npm are and how to install them, we can turn our attention to the first of their common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

- What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?  
Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work environment readiness.

- In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?  
Work environment readiness because you're already used to the process, which allows you to better focus on the task/learning needed in a new role.

- How does pair programming work?  
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
