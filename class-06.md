# DOM
**What is the DOM?**
Document Object Model is the API used to interact with the elements of an HTML page.

**Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.**
JavaScript uses the DOM to select, interact, and alter elements contained in the HTML.

## JavaScript Objects
**How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**
An object is a group of key value pairs that allows you to save any type of information youd like as a value, and access that information using the key name.

**What are some advantages to creating object literals?**
Object literals are created by writing out the propers when insantiating it, rather than creating it with a class.

**How do objects differ from arrays?**
You access values using an index in an array, whereas you use property names to access values in an object.

**Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.**
Bracket notation allows you to access a variable when referencing a value, dot notation does not allow this.

**Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?**
Using the this keyword allows you to access the property of the specific object you are working with.
