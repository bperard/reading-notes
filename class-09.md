# Forms

## HTML Forms

**Why are forms so important in web development?**
Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users

**When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?**
Clear purpose for the user, type of input needed, constraints on the input/validation

**List 5 form elements and explain their importance.**

- The *form* element formally defines a form and attributes that determine the form's behavior.
- The *label* element is the formal way to define a label for an HTML form widget.
- The *button* element performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.
- The *fieldset* HTML element is used to group several controls as well as labels (label) within a web form.
- The *input* HTML element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user

## JavaScript Events

**How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?**
Actions that happen after a specific trigger in the system you've programmed

**When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?**
The name of the event, and the handler function.

**Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?**
The event object keeps information about the events that occur. The target is useful because it let's you see which element was involved in the action, and determine what kind of response, if any, should take place.

**What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?**
Bubbling starts on the innermost element moves outward, capturing starts on the parent element and moves down.
