# Local Storage

**Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?**
It allows state to be saved locally so user data can persist between sessions.

**What information should not be stored in local storage?**
Sensitive data should not be saved in local storage.

**Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?**
Local storage can save data in sting format, so you can use JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() to work with data being sent and received from local storage.
